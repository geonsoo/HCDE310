## Getting set up 
## This loads the Facebook group data as a list of dictionaries
posts = json.load(open('hw5feed.json'))['data']


## This extracts 3 dictionaries from the list of posts, which you will use
## as examples throughout the homework

mypost1 = posts[7]            # this is a post with one comment
mypost2 = posts[2]           # this is post without comments
mypost3 = posts[39]           # this is a post with likes and a comment

## Here is what a post dictionary looks like
print "==== example post ===="
print pretty(mypost1)

## posts is a list of dictionaries
print 'there are', len(posts), 'posts!'

####################
### Building Block 1
## extracting the name of a poster
gap('building block 1')

## write code that extracts and prints the data associated with the 'from'
## key in mypost1
print mypost1['from']


## write code that extracts and prints the name of the user who posted mypost1
#<your-code-here>
print mypost1['from']['name']


## write a function postPoster() that extracts and returns the short name of
## the post from a post dictionary. 
## Use the shortname function within your function.
#<your-code-here>

def postPoster(pd):
    #parameter: pd - a post dictionary
    return shortname(pd['from']['name'])


## uncomment the following three lines to test
print postPoster(mypost1)
print postPoster(mypost2)
print postPoster(mypost3)

####################
### Building block 2
## extracting the number of comments for a post
gap('building block 2')

## some posts have comments
print mypost1['comments']

## other posts don't
## if you uncomment the following line, you'll get a
## key error -- the comments key isn't defined when
## there are no comments
#print mypost2['comments']

## here are what comment dictionaries look like
gap("a post's comment data structure")
print pretty(mypost1['comments'])

## this is how you get the number of comments from a comment dictionary
## if, and only if, that dictionary has comments (otherwise you get
## an error)
print "Comment count:", len(mypost1['comments']['data'])

## write a function called postCommentCount() that extracts and
## returns the number of comments from a post dictionary.
#<your-code-here>

def postCommentCount(pd):
    #parameter: pd is a post dictionary
    if 'comments' in pd:
        return len(pd['comments']['data'])
    else:
        return 0

## uncomment the following two lines of code. they should print 1 and 0
print postCommentCount(mypost1)
print postCommentCount(mypost2)

### Building block 3
# extracting like counts (this similar to comment counts, but
# the likes dictionary will be missing if there are no likes)

## here are what 'like' dictionaries contains
gap("a post's likes data structure")
print pretty(mypost3['likes'])

## but some posts don't have likes. You get an error when
## you uncomment the following line
#print pretty(mypost1['likes'])

## write code that gets the number of likes from mypost3
## and prints it as "Likes: #"
#<your-code-here>

print "Likes: %d"%len(mypost3['likes']['data'])

## write a function called postLikeCount() that extracts and
## returns the number of likes from a post dictionary
## if the dictionary does not contain any likes, it should return 0
#<your-code-here>
def postLikeCount(pd):
    #parameter: pd is a post dictionary
    if 'likes' in pd:
        return len(pd['likes']['data'])
    else:
        return 0

## the following two lines should print 0 and 12 when uncommented
print postLikeCount(mypost1)
print postLikeCount(mypost3)

### Putting it all together
# Print out one line for each post in the dataset using the 3 functions
# that you have written(postPoster(), postCommentCount(), postLikeCount())
# Your output should look like:
#   Shortname posted to the group and received X comments and Y likes
#   with one line per post
gap("Task")
#<your-code-here>
for post in posts:
    print "%s posted to the group and received %d comments and %d likes."%(postPoster(post),postCommentCount(post),postLikeCount(post))
